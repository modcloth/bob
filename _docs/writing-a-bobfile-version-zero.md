# Writing a Bobfile - Version 0 (deprecated)

The basic ingredients to a Bob-build are the `docker-builder` executable and a
`Bobfile` config file.  This page assumes that you have already
downloaded or built the `docker-builder` executable.  If you have not, please
check out the other docs referenced

## Writing a `Bobfile` Config

Here is an example `Bobfile` config file with each section explained.
Bob config files are written in [toml](https://github.com/mojombo/toml).
**NOTE:** The file does not have to be named `Bobfile`.  It can be named
whatever you want, and you can have as many bob config files as you
want.  The name `Bobfile` is just a convention.

```toml
# Bobfile
[docker]
build_opts = [
  "--rm",
  "--no-cache"
]
tag_opts = ["--force"]

[containers]

[containers.global]
registry = "rafecolton"
project = "my-app"
excluded = ["spec"]
tags = [
  "git:branch",
  "git:sha",
  "git:tag"
]

[containers.base]
Dockerfile = "Dockerfile.base"
included = [
  "Gemfile",
  "Gemfile.lock"
]
tags = ["base"]
skip_push = true

[containers.app]
Dockerfile = "Dockerfile.app"
```

### The `[docker]` Section

The `[docker]` section is used for declaring options that will be passed
to the `docker build` and `docker tag` commands.  The following stanzas
are available:

* `build_opts` - Array
* `tag_opts` - Array

### The `[containers]` Section

The `[containers]` section can have any number of sub-sections, where
each section represents a container to be built, tagged, and pushed.

#### The `[containers.global]` Section

The `[containers.global]` section is a special section that will get
merged into each of the other container sections, with the values in the
individual container section taking precedence over the global section.
For example, the above `Bobfile` could be rewritten as follows:

```toml
# Bobfile
[docker]
build_opts = [
  "--rm",
  "--no-cache"
]
tag_opts = ["-f"]

[containers]

[containers.base]
Dockerfile = "Dockerfile.base"
registry = "rafecolton"
project = "my-app"
excluded = ["spec"]
included = [
  "Gemfile",
  "Gemfile.lock"
]
tags = ["base"]
skip_push = true

[containers.app]
Dockerfile = "Dockerfile.app"
registry = "rafecolton"
project = "my-app"
excluded = ["spec"]
included = []
tags = [
  "git:branch",
  "git:sha",
  "git:tag"
]
```

#### The `[containers.<layer>]` Section

The following stanzas are available in a `[containers.<layer>]` section:

* `Dockerfile` - String (required) - the file to be used as the
  "Dockerfile" for the build
* `registry` - String
* `project` - String
* `excluded` - Array
* `included` - Array
* `tags` - Array
* `skip_push` - Bool - don't run `docker push...` after building this
  container

#### The `tags` Stanza

There are two types of tags: "string" tags an "macro" tags.  String tags
are simply strings to be used as tags.  In the above example, `"base"`
is a string tag.  **NOTE:** Bob does not do any validation of tags to
see whether or not they include invalid characters.

"Macro" tags are like helper functions for tagging.  All macro tags take
the form of `<type>:<name>`, where type might be the executable used for
the macro (e.g. `git`) and the name represents the command into which
the tag will be expanded.

The following macro tags are currently available:

* `git`
    - `git:branch` - the git branch of the app repo (`git rev-parse -q --abbrev-ref HEAD`)
    - `git:sha` - the full git sha of the app repo (`git rev-parse -q HEAD`)
    - `git:tag` - the shortened version of the app repo rev (`git describe --always`)

## Linting &amp; Building

Once you have written your `Bobfile` config file, linting and building
are both very simple.  First, place the `Bobfile` file at the top level
of your application repo. 

Then, to validate your config:

```bash
docker-builder lint <path>/<to>/Bobfile
```

and to build:

```bash
docker-builder build <path>/<to>/Bobfile.whatever

# or, if your config is just named "Bobfile", then from the repo top level...
docker-builder build
```
