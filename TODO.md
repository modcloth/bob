# TODO

* code coverage
* more `bats` tests?
* file reorganization within package dirs
* get rid of extra comments
* fill out [`README.md`](README.md)
* be able to disable push for a given repo
* make tags more like macros and strings rather than shell functions
* fill out any missing spots for documentation (i.e. stuff done to make
  lint pass)
* combine Log and Logger interface types (and just generally clean up
  the `log` package)
* document exit codes
* get TODOs into github issues
* have -q and -q -q options for quiet and REALLY quiet output
